# MLOps CI/CD Practice

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Machine Learning application using GitHub Actions and Hugging Face Spaces.

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- GitHub account
- Hugging Face account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/mlops-ci-cd-practice.git
   cd mlops-ci-cd-practice
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   make install
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the Gradio application, use the following command:
```
make run
```

### CI/CD Workflows

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The CI workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It runs on every push and pull request to ensure code quality through linting.
  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: The CD workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/cd.yml`. It deploys the Gradio app to Hugging Face Spaces whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
